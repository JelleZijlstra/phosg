Phosg is a basic C++ wrapper library around some common C routines.

A short summary of its contents:
- Read-write locks and guards (C++ doesn't have these in std as of C++14)
- Byteswapping functions
- Directory listing, smart-pointer fopen and stat functions
- Basic image manipulation/drawing
- Basic JSON (de)serialization
- LRU set implementation
- Network helpers (IP address parsing/formatting, listen/connect sockets)
- Process listing and name <> PID mapping
- String helpers like printf, split, time/size formatting, etc.
